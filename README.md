# Open Source AI Definition (OSAID) Review

My analysis of the [Open Source Initiative (OSI)](https://opensource.org)'s "[Deep Dive](https://opensource.org/deepdive)" into Artificial Intelligence in 2023-2024.

Follows on from my post on [The Open Source(ish) AI Definition (OSAID)](https://samjohnston.org/2024/09/23/the-open-sourceish-ai-definition-osaid/) regarding their annoucement "[Draft v.0.0.9 of the Open Source AI Definition is available for comments](https://discuss.opensource.org/t/draft-v-0-0-9-of-the-open-source-ai-definition-is-available-for-comments/513) and the [resulting discussion](https://discuss.opensource.org/t/the-open-source-ish-ai-definition-osaid/580)".

Resulted in the thread [We heard you: letâ€™s focus on substantive discussion](https://discuss.opensource.org/t/we-heard-you-lets-focus-on-substantive-discussion/589).
