1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,400
So hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,760
Welcome to the Twitter town hall of the open source

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,960
AI definition.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,200
And today we're going to go very quickly over the

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,000
slides and then we're going to have a dialogue with

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,680
Sam and Gerardo.

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:26,840
So why we need to define open source AI now?

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,760
This is a big topic.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,560
AI has been on the media.

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,080
And there's a lot going on regulation in the US

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,920
in Europe and a lot of companies are claiming they're

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,600
open. They're releasing open source AI when there might not

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,760
be the facts.

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,360
We do need a definition.

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,720
This is not a new content.

16
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,440
I don't mind if you just click through them.

17
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,800
If you want.

18
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,600
It's just mostly just to get them like I say,

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,080
see if there's any new content and get them on

20
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,080
the record and get them out there.

21
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,320
Alright, yeah, so I'll go very quickly here.

22
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,560
So here are the benefits of open source AI by

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,720
Leah from the Digital Public Goods Alliance, mostly around

24
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,760
transparency and safety, market, the concentration and AI

25
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,560
polyculture and diverse application.

26
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:32,440
So the whole process of defining open source AI at the OSI

27
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:42,840
started in 2022 and this started with interviews.

28
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,240
That was, we created a podcast and a panel with experts.

29
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,680
Later we have webinars, a webinar series.

30
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,960
And so.

31
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:59,280
This was really important for us to reach this point,

32
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,840
right? Where we created the definition.

33
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:12,360
Well, in late 2023, we had the co-design process led by Mair.

34
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,760
So we hired Mair.

35
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:22,360
She's independent, so she has no influence over the results regarding

36
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,680
sponsorships and et cetera.

37
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,080
And she really did her work as independent as possible.

38
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:36,480
She organized several activities online and in person as well.

39
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,360
And we had several questions that we wanted to answer.

40
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,280
So the first question was, what should this open source

41
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,800
principles mean for artificial intelligence?

42
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,320
So the principles would be used to use to study,

43
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,880
modify and to share.

44
00:02:53,880 --> 00:03:01,000
And so during this, the first, I would say the first months,

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,880
we changed the four freedoms of software and we adapted that to AI.

46
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,200
And we came up with these four freedoms.

47
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:18,040
Now, the second question was, what components must be open in order

48
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,200
for an AI system to be used, studied, modified and shared?

49
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,920
So we used the MOF framework, the model open framework created by the Linux

50
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,640
Foundation as the list of components.

51
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,280
And for each one, we evaluated the four freedoms, right?

52
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:40,240
We created four working groups, Yamachu, Bloom, Pythia and OpenCV.

53
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:47,880
And we started outreach to bring people to join

54
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,480
those working groups.

55
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,960
Each working group, they had a discussion.

56
00:03:53,960 --> 00:04:01,280
I believe the discussions were for several sessions.

57
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,400
It was not just one session where they.

58
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,360
They didn't actually find a consensus, so they actually voted.

59
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,600
And after voting, after every work group voted,

60
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,240
there was a compilation of those votes.

61
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,040
A publication of reports and that led to the definition.

62
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,400
It's worth highlighting here as well that one of the working groups,

63
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,400
Yamachu, they were able to cast negative votes.

64
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:41,320
And this the reason for that was that was supposed to happen with every working group.

65
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,760
But it seems it was too complicated.

66
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,840
So that was dropped after Yama cast a negative vote.

67
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,840
So that was the reason for that.

68
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,840
And then we started to work with the other working groups.

69
00:53:30,840 --> 00:54:00,820
Thank you.
