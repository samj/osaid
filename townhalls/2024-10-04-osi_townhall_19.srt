00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:08,640
So let's start the recording. Hello everyone, my name is Nick Vidal. I'm the Community Manager

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:16,800
at the OSI. Today I'll be presenting and staff will be joining us shortly for Q&A.

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,960
And but if you have again if you have any questions just put it on chats. Later we are going to open

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:36,000
up for Q&A. So today we're going to be talking about especially RC1 that was released two days

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,760
ago. And this release candidates has introduced a lot of changes and hopefully we're converging in

6
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:52,640
the right direction based on community feedback, right? Of course there are a lot of controversial

7
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,720
topics still. People are still asking about the community feedback. So I'm going to start with

8
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:54,800
the community feedback. So I'm going to start with the community feedback. So I'm going to start

9
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:54,880
with the community feedback. So I'm going to start with the community feedback. So I'm going to start

10
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,360
People are very passionate about their opinions.

11
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,700
And that's perfectly fine.

12
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,860
And we're here to hear everyone's opinion.

13
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:12,880
Now let's start with the question why define open source AI now, right?

14
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,060
Why now?

15
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:26,200
So of course, there has been a huge popularity of AI, especially large language models in

16
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,580
the past, I would say, two years.

17
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:34,820
And so this is something that has been over media.

18
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:41,760
People have been claiming that they actually have an open source AI or large language model.

19
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,040
But there's no clear definition of what that is.

20
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,540
What that actually entails.

21
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,600
What's actually open source AI.

22
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:57,580
And for that reason, OSI being the, I would say, the champion of open source, the open

23
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:04,840
source definition, we felt that it was important for us to step in, not just ourselves, but

24
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:14,020
together with other community members, other nonprofit organizations, to try to come up

25
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,020
with a more open source AI.

26
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,020
And we're here to hear everyone's opinion.

27
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:26,660
Bye.

28
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:28,380
Yes, bye.
