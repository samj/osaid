1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:13,120
Welcome everyone to our town hall. We're actually going to start having these town halls every week

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:21,040
until the OSAID is launched on October 28th. So we'll be seeing more of you. These are the

3
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:26,960
community agreements which you're familiar with if you've been here before. One mic, one speaker,

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,000
so allow one person to speak at a time, to take space, make space, if you tend to talk more,

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,600
pause to let others share, if you tend not to share we invite you to speak up and share your

6
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,880
opinions, to be kind to each other, just not acknowledging that the work is hard, but we can

7
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,920
still be gentle with each other. Obviously hate speech is not permitted in the meeting, that

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:55,920
hopefully is not a surprise, that we're trying to move forward, obviously, that obstacles are marked

9
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,840
to be discussed, but that we try to continue to make progress even when we find those, oh

10
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:10,400
Nick, I am seeing my whole slide, it's okay, that we seek solutions,

11
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,840
just because there are so many ways that this could not work and finding those ways that this

12
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,160
can work is needed. Does anyone have any other community agreements that they'd like us to

13
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,640
use as we conduct this meeting? You can share it in the chat.

14
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:39,760
Drinking a bubbly water, okay. Thank you Nick. So we're on version 0.0.9 which was released at

15
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:45,840
the end of last month, if you use that QR code you can view it online, I believe this is the

16
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:54,080
HackMD instance with the commenting function, and I'll go through that now. Next. Yeah, so the

17
00:01:54,080 --> 00:02:02,320
OpenSource AI definition has two parts in addition to the preamble, it affirms the four freedoms

18
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:11,280
as initially enunciated by the Free Software Foundation, but now applied to AI systems, so

19
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,800
grants the freedom to use the system for any purpose without asking permission, to study the

20
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,240
system and inspect its components, to modify the system for any purpose, including to change its

21
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:30,400
output, and to share the system again with or without modification and for any purpose.

22
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:37,600
Next. And then the second part of the definition is the preferred form

23
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,240
to make modifications, and again this is for machine learning, OpenSource AI system, right,

24
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:51,680
so the technology is part of what defines the preferred form, the particular methodology.

25
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:58,800
So first it requires open weights, so that's model weights and parameters, requires open code,

26
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:06,000
which means source code used to train and run the system, and it requires data information,

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,960
which is the data set or detailed information about the data used to train the system,

28
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,560
and that actually we should change that particular way we're phrasing that,

29
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,920
because the detailed information about the data used to train and run the system is required,

30
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:31,840
whether or not a data set is also required. Okay, thank you. So what is next, September and

31
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:39,040
October? We're resolving the comments. We intended to release our RC1 this week. It is still being

32
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,640
edited for reasons some of you may have heard the conversation is having with Gerardo, but there's

33
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:51,280
still some edits being made to RC1, the release candidate one. Our goal is that we will launch

34
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:58,240
that next week though, at the Nerdeala conference in Argentina, and then we will have a staple

35
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:06,160
version launched at All Things Open on October 8th, 28th at the end of next month. Next.

36
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:13,120
And also just so you know the requirements that we have internally for this launch,

37
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,800
that the board requires that the open source AI definition or OSAID be supported by diverse

38
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:28,160
stakeholders and specifically for stakeholder types, end users, deployers, developers, and

39
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:35,920
subjects. So I think in this slide there are not definitions of that, but we can define that if

40
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:42,640
there's interest, and that that be global representation. Secondly, that there are real

41
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:49,280
life examples of these AI systems, so it is not, the definition does not result in an empty set.

42
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:55,680
And finally, that we are able to complete this process by that

43
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,400
deadline that I gave previously of the end of October. Next.

44
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,480
So this is just to let you know where we are. We're in September.

45
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,480
We have done a lot of, we and actually our partners, have done a lot of sharing

46
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:22,000
the OSAID internationally this month. We had Rahmat, who is a organizational endorser,

47
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
which I'll talk about later, and co-designer presented the OSAID in Dakar at the Deep Learning

48
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,760
in Dhaba. We had Taranima Prabhakar, who's a, I'd say a friend, a friend of the OSAID,

49
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,920
and the founder of Taddle, an open source AI system, presented at FOSS India in Bangalore.

50
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:47,280
I presented in the US at Regen AI, Ashland's in the state of Oregon.

51
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:55,920
Stefano presented the OSAID in Vienna at Lung's Foundation Europe, and then I will,

52
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:04,720
inshallah, present in Buenos Aires next week at NERD-ER-LA. And then next week, next month, we

53
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:12,560
will present at All Things Open, which is in Raleigh, and then we have a data workshop, which

54
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:20,880
will, which is a data policy paper that deals with, I would say, data questions emerging from the

55
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,400
open source AI definition, but is not specifically working on the definition,

56
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:32,080
and that will generate a white paper. Okay, yes, get involved. So the big ask,

57
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,720
do you want to do the ask, Nick, the endorse the OSAID ask, because you did, you did this web form.

58
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:47,280
So do you want to do it, or shall I? Yes, so right now, if you join the website,

59
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:55,840
and if you look under the drafts, there's a form now for endorsements. So if you'd like to join

60
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:05,520
that, and I'll paste the link here as well to the form, you can endorse that either as an individual

61
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:15,040
or as an organization. So let me just drop the link to the form, and it's very simple. You just

62
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:24,320
add your name, your role, your institution, and if you're endorsing this as an individual or

63
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:32,800
as an institution, or both, that's an option as well. You can add your comments, and once we

64
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:41,840
are going to be releasing this, the new release candidates, we'll also showcase some quotes,

65
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:49,120
and if you add a message there, that should appear as well. Thanks so much. Next slide.

66
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:57,680
So this is also just sharing with you the definition, and well, you can go back to that

67
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:11,680
colorful one. Okay, well, they, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah. So basically, just to say this is a call,

68
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:21,280
another call for public participation, that anyone who is on the web and would like to endorse the

69
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:27,840
OSAID is welcome to do so. We do, as Nick said, have the option for organizations to endorse the

70
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:35,600
OSAID, which is in a more formal process, but also any individual can choose to endorse the OSAID,

71
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:44,800
and what that means is that when we do have our official launch in October, that your name and

72
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,640
affiliation will be listed on the landing page as an endorser, kind of like the signature at

73
00:08:50,640 --> 00:09:03,600
the end of a document. So, yes, thank you. Next. Hi. So I think that gave, yeah, I think that

74
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,880
gave that information that I was just describing. We can put it up in text still, go back. Some

75
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:16,160
people like to read as well as to hear information. Could you go back to that previous slide, Nick?

76
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,240
Thank you. Yeah, so this is just affirming that there's individual and organizational,

77
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,440
and it's clarifying what endorsement means, which is that your name is going on, it says

78
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,440
your press release, but it's a public statement that will be on our website, announcing the OSAID,

79
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,800
the web form, and then you can email or DM Nick or I if you have any questions about this,

80
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,760
in addition to the Q&A we're about to have. Now we can go on to the final slide.

81
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,880
Yep, so that's our request. We would love your endorsement of the OSAID,

82
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:59,280
and to participate in our public forum, which has always been available, and attend weekly town

83
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:06,080
halls are the ways to currently participate in the process, and that QR code is to the forum,

84
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,720
I believe. So if you go to the next slide.

85
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:21,360
I will open it up to Q&A, and please, please raise your hand, and I or Nick will call on you,

86
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:28,560
and allowing everyone to have a comment before we have double up on comments from any one person,

87
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,760
and you can also text in the chat if you would like to do that instead of speaking aloud.

88
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:40,240
But yeah, I would love to have your comments and questions.

89
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,240
All right.

90
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,920
All right. Hello, or Nick, are there any comments or questions that you feel might be interesting

91
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,520
for us to talk through? Is there anything, anything that I can clarify?

92
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:03,120
I know that you're going to be talking about the OSAID, and I'm going to be talking about
