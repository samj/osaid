00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:09,440
All right, everyone, and welcome to the final town hall before the release of version 1.0.

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:21,280
The last week of October, on October 28th, will be at all things open, and there will be a public announcement of a sort.

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:30,260
And so let's recap just a little bit for everyone who may have not followed.

4
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:42,120
We have received a grant from the Alfred Sloan Foundation to conduct part of this work, so we're grateful for that, and a sponsorship donation from Mercado Libre.

5
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,640
We're also very grateful for that contribution.

6
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,980
Let's go through the reason why we're doing this, because people are asking us, why don't you take a break?

7
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,280
Why don't you wait a little bit?

8
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,620
Are you ready for it?

9
00:00:54,620 --> 00:01:01,160
The thing is that we need to respond to what's happening already outside.

10
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:07,600
So we know that this is a challenging effort, and it's been a hard conversation to drive.

11
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:22,600
But we also are in a space where the term open source AI is being used and referred in many different areas from the market, from...

12
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:39,700
companies, organizations, and regulators are all referring to the term open source with the AI space and with the AI world right after it.

13
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:51,720
And our stakeholders in general, the open source initiatives, supporters and communities keep asking us the same thing.

14
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,040
Why is this not open source?

15
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,420
Why are you not going to...

16
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,980
Why are you not saying...

17
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:01,120
Why are you not correcting these statements?

18
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,320
Right.

19
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,140
And this was visible a long time ago.

20
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:17,180
Like we started noticing that this issue was of AI not having a clear understanding was very visible when I started at the Open Source Initiative in 2022.

21
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,800
So we started that year to interview experts in various areas.

22
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,260
Because this is a new space.

23
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,680
It's a new domain that we don't have familiarity with.

24
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:35,640
And so we started educating ourselves with a series of interviews that we published as a podcast.

25
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:46,540
We also held discussions in four different areas in the business, society, impact, legal, academic research, and with experts.

26
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:52,640
And we published the result and the results of all of that in a nice, easy to read article.

27
00:02:52,640 --> 00:03:11,160
I recommend you all to go find it and read it to get an initial overview of why AI and machine learning, this machine learning space is so radically different from the software space that we are very familiar with.

28
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:22,480
And at the end of this research that continued in 2023 with a series of webinars, we decided that we needed to have...

29
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,880
We had to have a process that was wide.

30
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,000
It was...

31
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:40,040
It had to be global and it had to be involving not the typical people who you find in the Open Source conferences or in the Open Source software circles.

32
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:52,320
It needed to be something that was involving researchers and from other parts of the world, but also experts in different specific domains, not just the software space.

33
00:03:52,320 --> 00:04:05,920
We needed to have experts in civil, civic society and environmental impact, legal experts in copyright, but also in privacy rights and indigenous knowledge.

34
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:13,440
All of those, all of areas that we were not traditionally familiar with in the Open Source software space.

35
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,040
And we held this...

36
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,200
It was...

37
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,160
This is how we started with this process called co-designing, which is a process.

38
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:36,600
That is a technique basically to design new things with the people who are going to be impacted by it, not for them.

39
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,280
And the process was structured in a series of questions.

40
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:52,000
The first question that we asked the groups of volunteers that we have made a concerted effort to be different, diverse with various dimensions of the process.

41
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:02,560
And we tried to assemble working groups that had all of these characteristics represented.

42
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:10,400
We asked the first question, what should the open, the meaning of Open Source and the free software principles, how do we translate them?

43
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,400
How do we apply them to artificial intelligence space?

44
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,120
And it was fairly easy to transform it slightly wordsmith, if you want.

45
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,840
The four freedoms, the freedom to choose, freedom to use, freedom to use the tools.

46
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:32,040
The freedom to use, study, modify and share and apply them with changing some of the words so that they would fit the machine learning, the artificial intelligence space.

47
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:40,560
So then the next question we asked them is what components of AI systems you need in order to use, study, modify and share?

48
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,760
Again, this is because it's a new space.

49
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:51,680
We know that there are multiple artifacts of different nature and we need to ask them, the working groups to help us.

50
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,040
Understand what components are required.

51
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:15,600
And we have these the working group set up to analyze, for example, systems, some that we knew were not open source and some that we knew are more open in different ways, like the difference between bloom and Pithia and some of like OpenCV that we know is works in the open source space.

52
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,160
So but it's not generative AI.

53
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,520
It's more it is about computer vision.

54
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,920
But still using machine learning techniques.

55
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:30,880
So we asked them also to rank the importance of each of the components.

56
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:39,120
And they give us indications of of how to how to proceed, how to move forward.

57
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,560
And we released a new draft of the definition.

58
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:51,360
Now, with that draft definition version version zero zero six, we asked another question to other people, which of these if you use these.

59
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:59,200
These criteria listed in zero zero six, which of these systems actually comply with those criteria?

60
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:21,200
And we asked we had these reviewers and many more involved and they give us they give us the the validated the the theory and that theory confirmed what we thought was going to be happening.

61
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,200
So we asked them to rank the components.

62
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,200
And we asked them to rank the components.

63
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,040
And we asked them to rank the components.

64
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,040
And we asked them to rank the components.

65
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,880
And we asked them to rank the components.

66
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,880
And we asked them to rank the components.

67
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,720
And we asked them to rank the components.

68
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,720
And we asked them to rank the components.

69
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,560
And we asked them to rank the components.

00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,400
And we asked them to rank the components.

73
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,240
And we asked them to rank the components.

74
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,240
And we asked them to rank the components.

75
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,080
And we asked them to rank the components.

76
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,080
And we asked them to rank the components.

77
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,920
And we asked them to rank the components.

78
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,920
And we asked them to rank the components.
