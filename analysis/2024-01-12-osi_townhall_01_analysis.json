The atmosphere was collaborative, but there were underlying tensions regarding data transparency and legal considerations.",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "The need to define Open Source AI, not just machine learning.",
    "Incorporating four freedoms in the AI definition.",
    "Challenges in including training data within these freedoms.",
    "Stakeholder inclusion is crucial for the definition process.",
    "Legal frameworks and documents are key to granting freedoms."
  ],
  "dataMentions": "There were significant discussions on whether and how to include training data in the Open Source AI definition. Questions were raised about the level of access required to the training data, whether the full dataset or just a description would suffice. This was identified as a critical and delicate issue.",
  "quotes": [
    "'If I like an AI system, I must be free to share it with other people.'",
    "'The question is what kind of access? What level of access? The full on training data set? Or is it sufficient to have a detailed description of what went into it?'",
    "'We cannot have an open source AI that will never be transparent, will never be explainable or fair.'"
