You've heard a lot from me on this already, so I asked `gpt-o1` use reasoning to critique the release candidate from a practical perspective with respect to the four freedoms (which is my primary concern). It agrees the proposed definition still fails to protect 2 or 3 of the 4 freedoms. If this were an exam, it would get an 'F' grade.

I also ran a small straw poll of AI practitioners (n=15) asking "What is the preferred form in which a practitioner would modify a model?". Fully 87% chose Data (i.e., training datasets) over Model (i.e., weights & biases). We could run a larger and more controlled survey, but this is not even close. Let's avoid contentious claims to the contrary when this is clearly a compromise, resulting in a compromised definition.

I do appreciate the efforts to incorporate feedback right up until the last minute, and I see you've switched to "no new features, only bug fixes". Hopefully there will be an acknowledgement at launch that this is a living document, as it took until v1.9 to get the OSD mostly right. There should be a concerted effort to tighten it up and fully protect the four freedoms in the future.

> **Assessment of the OSAID's Protection of the Four Freedoms from a Practical Perspective**
> 
> While the OSAID aims to protect the four essential freedoms of Free Software, a practical examination reveals limitations that may hinder a researcher's ability to study an AI system and a practitioner's capacity to modify it effectively.
> 
> 1. **Freedom to Run the Program (Freedom 0):**
>   * **Practical Perspective:** Users can run the AI system without restrictions.
>   * **Critique:** This freedom is upheld in practice, as the OSAID explicitly allows the use of the system for any purpose.
> 2. **Freedom to Study the Program (Freedom 1):**
>   * **Practical Perspective:** Without access to the actual training data, researchers face significant obstacles in thoroughly understanding the AI system.
>     * **Data Analysis Limitations:** Key aspects like biases, data quality issues, and representativeness cannot be fully assessed without the raw data.
>     * **Transparency Concerns:** Detailed Data Information may not substitute for direct data access, leaving gaps in understanding how the model processes inputs to produce outputs.
>   * **Critique:** The OSAID permits withholding the training data, relying instead on "Data Information." This undermines the practical ability to study the system comprehensively, as critical insights are often derived from examining the data itself.
> 3. **Freedom to Modify the Program (Freedom 2):**
>   * **Practical Perspective:** Modifying an AI system typically involves retraining or fine-tuning the model, which requires access to the training data.
>     * **Retraining Challenges:** Without the original data, practitioners cannot retrain the model to correct issues, adapt it to new domains, or improve its performance.
>     * **Limited Modifications:** Modifications are constrained to code-level changes or adjustments to parameters, which may not significantly alter the model's behavior.
>   * **Critique:** The lack of access to training data severely limits the practitioner's ability to modify the AI system meaningfully. The OSAID's allowance for non-disclosure of data creates a barrier to exercising this freedom fully.
> 4. **Freedom to Share the Program (Freedom 3):**
>   * **Practical Perspective:** Users can share the AI system, but potential legal constraints may impede this freedom.
>     * **Licensing Ambiguities:** The OSAID mentions that parameters "shall be made available under OSI-approved terms," but does not clarify the legal status of model parameters.
>     * **Intellectual Property Issues:** The possibility of patents or other legal instruments can restrict sharing, even if the OSAID's licensing requirements are met.
>   * **Critique:** While the OSAID supports sharing in principle, practical obstacles like intellectual property rights can limit this freedom. The definition does not fully address how such legal issues might affect the ability to share the AI system.
> 
> **Overall Critique:**
> 
> The OSAID's provisions allow for the non-disclosure of training data and do not adequately prevent other legal mechanisms (like patents or trademarks) from restricting the use, study, modification, or sharing of AI systems. As a result, the four essential freedoms are only partially protected in practice. Researchers and practitioners may find themselves unable to exercise these freedoms fully due to practical limitations imposed by the definition's allowances and omissions.
