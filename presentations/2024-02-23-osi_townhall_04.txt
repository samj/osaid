One Mic, One Speaker -- Please allow one person to speak at a time.
Take Space, Make Space -- If you tend to talk more, we invite you to
make space for others to share. If you tend not to share, we invite you
to speak up.
Kindness -- This work is hard, but we don't have to be. Gentleness and
curiosity help. Those who use insults or hate speech will need to leave
the meeting.
Forward Motion -- We advance by focusing on what is possible in the
moment and doing it. Obstacles are marked for later discussion, not
used to stop the process. If we hit a boulder, we note it on the map and
keep walking. We'll come back and unearth it later on.
Solution-Seeking -- This work is so complex that focusing on what
won't work will stop it. Suggesting new ideas, options, and proposals is
vulnerable, but crucial. All of us are needed to make this work.
Anything else?

What is Open Source AI
To be Open Source, an AI system needs to be available under
legal terms that grant the freedoms to:
● Use the system for any purpose and without having to ask
for permission.
● Study how the system works and inspect its components.
● Modify the system to change its recommendations,
predictions or decisions to adapt to your needs.
● Share the system with or without modiﬁcations, for any
purpose.

Focus narrowing on machine learning

● Narrowing the deﬁnitional scope from any AI
system to ML speciﬁcally
● Goal is to increase the accuracy and precision of
the deﬁnition we create
● Change will appear in version 0.0.6 this month
24

Questions from the forum
● In other words, the use of this “system”
terminology is a complication that may have the
effect of narrowing the perceived scope of what
the OSAID covers. Is the thought that the ordinary
OSD kicks in in cases where purportedly you don’t
have a “system”?
(Richard Fontana)
25

Next steps
● Final vote compilation next week
● Version 0.0.6 release early March

researcher in
academia or
industry)

Writes or edits
the open source
license to be
applied to the AI
system or
component;
includes
compliance
(e.g., IP lawyer)

Writes or edits
rules governing
licenses and
systems (e.g.
government
policy-maker)

Seeks to study,
use modify, or
share an open
source AI
system (e.g. AI
engineer, health
researcher,
education
researcher)

Consumes a
system output,
but does not
seek to study,
use, modify, or
share the
system (e.g.,
student using a
chatbot to write
a report, artist
creating an
image)

Affected

downstream by
a system output
without
interacting with it
intentionally;
