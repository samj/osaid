One Mic, One Speaker -- Please allow one person to speak at a time.
Take Space, Make Space -- If you tend to talk more, we invite you to
make space for others to share. If you tend not to share, we invite you
to speak up.
Kindness -- This work is hard, but we don't have to be. Gentleness and
curiosity help. Those who use insults or hate speech will need to leave
the meeting.
Forward Motion -- We advance by focusing on what is possible in the
moment and doing it. Obstacles are marked for later discussion, not
used to stop the process. If we hit a boulder, we note it on the map and
keep walking. We'll come back and unearth it later on.
Solution-Seeking -- This work is so complex that focusing on what
won't work will stop it. Suggesting new ideas, options, and proposals is
vulnerable, but crucial. All of us are needed to make this work.
Anything else?

The objective for 2024

Open Source AI Deﬁnition
version 1.0

Deﬁnition of AI system

Preamble
Out of scope issues
4 freedoms
License checklist

How Open Source came to be
1: Legal framework

2: Principles

3: Licenses

Copyright applied to
software, ﬁrst.

The GNU Manifesto
lays the ground to
oppose privatization.

Copyleft is a hack on
copyright.

This new artifact
became privatized
work.
Researchers
complained.

A community forms
around these
principles.

Incorporating the
principles, serving as
the Constitution of a
forming community.

Golden Rule applied to AI
If I like an AI system I must be free to share it with other people.

What we’ve learned so far
● We need to deﬁne Open Source AI, in general, not just
machine learning
● OECD’s deﬁnition of AI is well accepted (caveat: decisions)
“An AI system is a machine-based system that, for explicit or
implicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to
generate outputs such as predictions, content,
recommendations, or decisions that can inﬂuence physical or
virtual environments. Different AI systems vary in their levels of
autonomy and adaptiveness after deployment.” (2023)

Matching expectations

AI deserves to enjoy the
beneﬁts of Open Source
● autonomy
● transparency
● collaborative
improvement
● ensuring the agency of
the user

Policy makers, academia and
industry are focusing on
● transparency
● trustworthiness
● reliability
● transparency
● explainability
● fairness
● safety etc

What basic freedoms do we need?
What is the preferred form to make modiﬁcations to an AI system?

What is Open Source AI
To be Open Source, an AI system needs to be available under
legal terms that grant the freedoms to:
● Use the system for any purpose and without having to ask
for permission.
● Study how the system works and inspect its components.
● Modify the system to change its recommendations,
predictions or decisions to adapt to your needs.
● Share the system with or without modiﬁcations, for any
purpose.

modiﬁcations to an AI system?

an AI system?

For each artifact,
evaluate which
laws apply. Some
will be under
“Intellectual
Property” regimes,
some will be under
other regimes.

We’ll match the
components and
the identiﬁed legal
frameworks with
the terms of the
legal documents
already in use,
where available.

After repeating
this exercise
enough times,
we’ll be able to
generalize the
outcomes and
write the specs to
evaluate the
freedoms granted.

Small working groups to analyze systems
For each in:
- Pythia
- Llama2
- BLOOM
- Mistral
- Phi2
- …

● What do you need to give an input and
get an output? (use)
● What do you need to give an input and
get a different output? (modify)
● What do you need to understand why
given an input, you get that output?
(study)
● What do you need to let others give an
input and get an output? (share)
What’s the preferred form to make
modiﬁcations to an AI system?

Example: Pythia – INCOMPLETE! DON’T QUOTE!
Freedom to use:
- What do you need to
give an input and get an
output from Pythia?

❓

Example: Pythia – INCOMPLETE! DON’T QUOTE!
Freedom to study:
- What do you need to

given an input, gives one
output?

Example: Pythia – INCOMPLETE! DON’T QUOTE!
Freedom to modify:
- What do you need to

Freedom to share:
- What do you need to let
others give an input and
get an output from
Pythia or a version you
modiﬁed?

Then the rest
-

get the legal framework for each component
get the legal documents
analyze the documents
write up a summary

Repeat for at least 4-5 AI systems, ideally not just LLMs
and “Generative AI”

It doesn’t end with v. 1.0
We’ll need to deﬁne rules for maintenance and review of the
Deﬁnition

OSI’s immediate next steps
- more publicity to the process
- public discussion forum
- bi-weekly townhalls
- more opportunities to volunteer
- update project landing page
- reach out to more stakeholders
- raise funds for 2024 meetings
- setup the board for review and approval of v. 1.0

Gazillions of laws

A typical $FOO is made of
Software for
training and
testing, inference

Model architecture
and its weights and
training
parameters

Raw data and
prepared datasets,
for training and
testing

All that is written by
a human and
copyrightable must
be Open Source.

No restrictions on:

It’s not the preferred
form for making
modiﬁcations to
model/weights.

●

Who can use them

●

How they’re used

●

Retraining

●

Redistribution

Does that mean the
Deﬁnition can ignore
the original data?

What are Open Source AI Components
For the purposes of today’s work, we are deﬁning the
components* of an AI system broadly as:
● Code Instruction for a computer to complete a task.
● Model Abstracted representation of what an AI system
has learned from the training data.
● Data Information converted into a form efficient for
processing and transfer.
