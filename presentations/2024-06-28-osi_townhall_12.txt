One Mic, One Speaker -- Please allow one person to speak at a time.
Take Space, Make Space -- If you tend to talk more, we invite you to
make space for others to share. If you tend not to share, we invite you
to speak up.
Kindness -- This work is hard, but we don't have to be. Gentleness and
curiosity help. Those who use insults or hate speech will need to leave
the meeting.
Forward Motion -- We advance by focusing on what is possible in the
moment and doing it. Obstacles are marked for later discussion, not
used to stop the process. If we hit a boulder, we note it on the map and
keep walking. We'll come back and unearth it later on.
Solution-Seeking -- This work is so complex that focusing on what
won't work will stop it. Suggesting new ideas, options, and proposals is
vulnerable, but crucial. All of us are needed to make this work.
Anything else?
