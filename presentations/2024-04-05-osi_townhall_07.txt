One Mic, One Speaker -- Please allow one person to speak at a time.
Take Space, Make Space -- If you tend to talk more, we invite you to
make space for others to share. If you tend not to share, we invite you
to speak up.
Kindness -- This work is hard, but we don't have to be. Gentleness and
curiosity help. Those who use insults or hate speech will need to leave
the meeting.
Forward Motion -- We advance by focusing on what is possible in the
moment and doing it. Obstacles are marked for later discussion, not
used to stop the process. If we hit a boulder, we note it on the map and
keep walking. We'll come back and unearth it later on.
Solution-Seeking -- This work is so complex that focusing on what
won't work will stop it. Suggesting new ideas, options, and proposals is
vulnerable, but crucial. All of us are needed to make this work.
Anything else?

Revising draft

Open Source AI Deﬁnition v. 0.0.6
An Open Source AI is an AI system made available to the public under terms that grant the freedoms to:
●
●
●
●

Use the system for any purpose and without having to ask for permission.
Study how the system works and inspect its components.
Modify the system for any purpose, including to change its output.
Share the system for others to use with or without modiﬁcations, for any purpose.

Precondition to exercise these freedoms is to have access to the preferred form to make modiﬁcations to
the system. For machine learning systems that means having public access to:
●

●
transparency
requirements
only

●

Data: Sufficiently detailed information on how the system was trained, including the training
methodologies and techniques, the training data sets used, information about the provenance of
those data sets, their scope and characteristics; how the data was obtained and selected, the
labeling procedures and data cleaning methodologies.
Code: The code used for pre-processing data, the code used for training, validation and testing, the
supporting libraries like tokenizers and hyperparameters search code (if used), the inference code,
and the model architecture.
Model: The model parameters, including weights. Where applicable, these should include
checkpoints from key intermediate stages of training as well as the ﬁnal optimizer state.

Phase 1: Deciding Required Components
Component Voting

January 15

Vote
Compilation
Recommendation
Report
example: Llama 2

Process: From mid-January through February,
system workgroups voted on which components
should be required for a system to be deﬁned as
open. These votes were then publicly tabulated and a recommendations
report was publicly shared on the forum. The recommendations became
version 0.0.6 of the deﬁnition.

March 10

Phase 2: Finetuning the Component Checklist
Deﬁnition v. 0.0.6
Checklist for Doc Review

Deﬁnition to Checklist: A
week after the v.0.0.6 release
in mid-March, we went back
the the workgroup members
to ask them to help us
ﬁnetune the requirements
checklist implied by version
0.0.6 (left).
This v 0.0.6 checklist includes
the components categorized
as required or likely required
by voting in Phase 1, plus a list
of data transparency
requirements already in force
under the EU’s AI Act.

Requirements: Open Source AI Deﬁnition 0.0.6

List of
components

Legal
frameworks

Legal
documents

What elements are
necessary to:
- use
- study
- modify
- share
an AI system?

For each
component,
evaluate which
laws apply. Some
will be under
“Intellectual
Property” regimes,
some will be
under other
regimes.

Next, match the
components and
legal frameworks with the
terms of the
legal documents,
if they exist.

These are listed in
deﬁnition v. 0.0.6.

Checklist
After repeating
this exercise
through multiple
systems, we’ll be
able to generalize
the outcomes and
write the specs to
evaluate the
freedoms granted.
These will appear
in deﬁnition 0.0.7.
