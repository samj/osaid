One Mic, One Speaker -- Please allow one person to speak at a time.
Take Space, Make Space -- If you tend to talk more, we invite you to
make space for others to share. If you tend not to share, we invite you
to speak up.
Kindness -- This work is hard, but we don't have to be. Gentleness and
curiosity help. Those who use insults or hate speech will need to leave
the meeting.
Forward Motion -- We advance by focusing on what is possible in the
moment and doing it. Obstacles are marked for later discussion, not
used to stop the process. If we hit a boulder, we note it on the map and
keep walking. We'll come back and unearth it later on.
Solution-Seeking -- This work is so complex that focusing on what
won't work will stop it. Suggesting new ideas, options, and proposals is
vulnerable, but crucial. All of us are needed to make this work.
Anything else?

What’s Next?

June - October 2024

● Complete validation phase
● Resolve comments, release v. 0.0.9 after
validation
● Cut the release candidate with sufficient
endorsement

Board Guidance
The OSI Board requires a deﬁnition that is:
Supported by diverse
stakeholders

Provides real-life
examples

Ready by October
2024

The deﬁnition needs to
have approval by end
users, developers,
deployers and subjects of
AI, globally.

The deﬁnition must include
relevant examples of AI
systems that comply with it
at the time of approval, so
cannot have an empty set.

A usable version of the
deﬁnition needs to be
ready for approval by the
board at the October
board meeting.

Approved June 21, 2024
