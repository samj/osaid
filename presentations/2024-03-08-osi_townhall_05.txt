One Mic, One Speaker -- Please allow one person to speak at a time.
Take Space, Make Space -- If you tend to talk more, we invite you to
make space for others to share. If you tend not to share, we invite you
to speak up.
Kindness -- This work is hard, but we don't have to be. Gentleness and
curiosity help. Those who use insults or hate speech will need to leave
the meeting.
Forward Motion -- We advance by focusing on what is possible in the
moment and doing it. Obstacles are marked for later discussion, not
used to stop the process. If we hit a boulder, we note it on the map and
keep walking. We'll come back and unearth it later on.
Solution-Seeking -- This work is so complex that focusing on what
won't work will stop it. Suggesting new ideas, options, and proposals is
vulnerable, but crucial. All of us are needed to make this work.

Deﬁnition of AI system

Preamble
Out of scope issues
4 freedoms
Legal checklist

4

What is Open Source AI
To be Open Source, an AI system needs to be available
under legal terms that grant the freedoms to:
● Use the system for any purpose and without having to
ask for permission.
● Study how the system works and inspect its
components.
● Modify the system to change its recommendations,
predictions or decisions to adapt to your needs.
● Share the system with or without modiﬁcations, for
any purpose.

Working group recommendations

Systems review plan
Planned phases and where we are now:
1. ✔ Analyze a sample of “AI systems” to identify precisely the
required components for study, use modiﬁcation, and sharing of
the entire system
2. For each component of these systems, check their availability
and the conditions for use/distribution (the legal documents)
3. Generalize the ﬁndings and complete a checklist for OSI license
committee to evaluate legal documents for AI systems (OSAID
“feature complete”)
4. Get endorsements from major stakeholders (RC1)
5. Keep reﬁning the OSAID, as it gains support from more
stakeholders (v. 1.0)

Systems
Selected to have diversity of approaches:
1. Pythia: open science project, with a permissive license
2. BLOOM: open science project, with lots of details
released but shared with a restrictive license
3. Llama 2: commercial project, accompanied by limited
amount of science and with a restrictive license
4. OpenCV: open source project, with ML components
outside of the generative AI space

Required Components Detail

3/7/24

●

A sufficiently detailed information on how the system was trained,
including the training methodologies and techniques, the training
data sets used, information about the provenance of those data
sets, their scope and characteristics; how the data was obtained
and selected, the labeling procedures and data cleaning
methodologies.

●

The code used for pre-processing data, the code used for training,
validation and testing.

●

The model parameters, including weights. Where applicable, these
should include checkpoints from key intermediate stages of
training as well as the ﬁnal optimizer state.

●

The supporting libraries like tokenizers and hyperparameters
search code (if used), the inference code, and model architecture.

14

Generalized text in v. 0.0.6
Precondition to exercise these freedoms
is to have access to the preferred form
to make modiﬁcations to the system.
Release date: Mar 11, 2024

15

Next steps
● Version 0.0.6 release on Monday
● Start step 2: For each system, check the availability
of required components and analyze their
conditions for use/distribution (the legal
documents)

includes
compliance
(e.g., IP lawyer)

Writes or edits

but does not
seek to study,
use, modify, or
share the
system (e.g.,
student using a
chatbot to write

creating an
image)

Affected
upstream or
downstream by
a system output
without
interacting with it
intentionally;
includes
