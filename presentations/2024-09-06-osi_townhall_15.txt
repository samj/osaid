One Mic, One Speaker -- Please allow one person to speak at a time.
Take Space, Make Space -- If you tend to talk more, we invite you to
make space for others to share. If you tend not to share, we invite you
to speak up.
Kindness -- This work is hard, but we don't have to be. Gentleness and
curiosity help. Those who use insults or hate speech will need to leave
the meeting.
Forward Motion -- We advance by focusing on what is possible in the
moment and doing it. Obstacles are marked for later discussion, not
used to stop the process. If we hit a boulder, we note it on the map and
keep walking. We'll come back and unearth it later on.
Solution-Seeking -- This work is so complex that focusing on what
won't work will stop it. Suggesting new ideas, options, and proposals is
vulnerable, but crucial. All of us are needed to make this work.

Open Source AI Deﬁnition

New Version 0.0.9

Released August 22, 2024

3

OSAID v.0.0.9
The preferred form of making modiﬁcations for a machine-learning Open
Source AI System must include:

Open

Weights
Model weights and
parameters

Open

+ Code +
Source code used
to train and run
the system

Data

Information
The dataset or
detailed information
about the data used
to train the system

OSAID v.0.0.9
The preferred form of making modiﬁcations for a machine-learning Open Source AI System must
include:

Weights
The model weights and
parameters, made available
under OSI-approved terms
Examples: checkpoints from key intermediate stages of training as
well as the ﬁnal optimizer state

OSAID v.0.0.9
The preferred form of making modiﬁcations for a machine-learning Open Source AI System must
include:

Code
The source code used to train and
run the system, made available
with OSI-approved licenses
Examples: code used for pre-processing data, training, validation and testing,
supporting libraries like tokenizers and hyperparameters search code,
inference code, and model architecture.

OSAID v.0.0.9
The preferred form of making modiﬁcations for a machine-learning Open Source AI System must
include:

Data

Information
Sufﬁciently detailed information about the data used to
train the system, so that a skilled person can recreate a
substantially equivalent system using the same or
similar data. Data information shall be made available
with licenses that comply with the Open Source
Deﬁnition.
Examples: training methodologies and
techniques, training data sets used, information
about the provenance of those data sets, their scope and characteristics, how the data
was obtained and selected, the labeling procedures and data cleaning methodologies.

Training Data in the OSAID
OSI afﬁrms the beneﬁts of full access to training data while acknowledging it
is not always possible for reasons of law, privacy norms, technical feasibility,
and cultural practice.
• Training data is valuable to study AI systems: to understand the biases that have been
learned, which can impact system behavior. But training data is not part of the preferred
form for making modiﬁcations to an existing AI system
• Data can be hard to share. Laws that permit training on data often limit the resharing of that
same data to protect copyright or other interests.
• Privacy rules also give a person the rightful ability to control their most sensitive information,
such as decisions about their health.
• Similarly, much of the world’s Indigenous knowledge is protected through mechanisms that
are not compatible with later-developed frameworks for rights exclusivity and sharing.
• Open training data (data that can be reshared) provides the best way to enable users to study
the system, along with the preferred form of making modiﬁcations.
• Public training data (data others can inspect as long as it remains available) also enables
users to study the work, along with the preferred form.

OSAID Approval Criteria
OSI Board requires a deﬁnition that is:
Supported
by diverse
stakeholders

Provides
real-life
examples

Ready by
October 2024

The deﬁnition
needs to have
approval by end
users, developers,
deployers and
subjects of AI,
globally.

The deﬁnition must
include relevant
examples of AI
systems that comply
with it at the time of
approval, so cannot
have an empty set.

A usable version
of the deﬁnition
needs to be ready
for approval by
the board at the
October board
meeting.

Approved June 21, 2024

Endorse the OSAID!
● In preparation for the ﬁnalization of RC1 at the
end of this month, we are seeking both individual
and organizational endorsements of the OSAID.
● “Endorsement” means your name and
organizational affiliation will be appended to a
press release announcing RC1.
● If you or your organization are interested in
endorsing the OSAID, email me or Mer at
