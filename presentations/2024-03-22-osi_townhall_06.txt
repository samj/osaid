One Mic, One Speaker -- Please allow one person to speak at a time.
Take Space, Make Space -- If you tend to talk more, we invite you to
make space for others to share. If you tend not to share, we invite you
to speak up.
Kindness -- This work is hard, but we don't have to be. Gentleness and
curiosity help. Those who use insults or hate speech will need to leave
the meeting.
Forward Motion -- We advance by focusing on what is possible in the
moment and doing it. Obstacles are marked for later discussion, not
used to stop the process. If we hit a boulder, we note it on the map and
keep walking. We'll come back and unearth it later on.
Solution-Seeking -- This work is so complex that focusing on what
won't work will stop it. Suggesting new ideas, options, and proposals is
vulnerable, but crucial. All of us are needed to make this work.
Anything else?

Working on

What is Open Source AI
An Open Source AI is an AI system made available to the public under terms that grant the freedoms to:
●
●
●
●

Use the system for any purpose and without having to ask for permission.
Study how the system works and inspect its components.
Modify the system for any purpose, including to change its output.
Share the system for others to use with or without modifications, for any purpose.

Data: transparency
requirements only

Precondition to exercise these freedoms is to have access to the preferred form to make modifications to the system. For machine learning
systems that means having public access to:
●
●
●

Data: Sufficiently detailed information on how the system was trained, including the training methodologies and techniques, the training
data sets used, information about the provenance of those data sets, their scope and characteristics; how the data was obtained and
selected, the labeling procedures and data cleaning methodologies.
Code: The code used for pre-processing data, the code used for training, validation and testing, the supporting libraries like tokenizers
and hyperparameters search code (if used), the inference code, and the model architecture.
Model: The model parameters, including weights. Where applicable, these should include checkpoints from key intermediate stages of
training as well as the final optimizer state.

We need to talk about “systems”
because openness is a combination
of availability of multiple artifacts

Alt: we talk about “open
weights” only

Checklist

What elements are
necessary to:
- use
- study
- modify
- share
an AI system?

For each artifact,
evaluate which
laws apply. Some
will be under
“Intellectual
Property” regimes,
some will be under
other regimes.

We’ll match the
components and
the identiﬁed legal
frameworks with
the terms of the
legal documents
already in use,
where available.

After repeating
this exercise
enough times,
we’ll be able to
generalize the
outcomes and
write the specs to
evaluate the
freedoms granted.

and/or
component that
will be studied,
used, modified,
or shared
through an open
source license
(e.g., ML
researcher in
academia or
industry)

Writes or edits
the open source
license to be
applied to the AI
system or
component;
includes
compliance
(e.g., IP lawyer)

Writes or edits
rules governing
licenses and
systems (e.g.
government
policy-maker)

Seeks to study,
use modify, or
share an open
source AI
system (e.g. AI
engineer, health
researcher,
education
researcher)

Consumes a
system output,
but does not
seek to study,
use, modify, or
share the
system (e.g.,
student using a
chatbot to write
a report, artist
creating an
image)

Affected

downstream by
a system output
without
interacting with it
intentionally;
