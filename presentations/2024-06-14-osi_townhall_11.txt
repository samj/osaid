One Mic, One Speaker -- Please allow one person to speak at a time.
Take Space, Make Space -- If you tend to talk more, we invite you to
make space for others to share. If you tend not to share, we invite you
to speak up.
Kindness -- This work is hard, but we don't have to be. Gentleness and
curiosity help. Those who use insults or hate speech will need to leave
the meeting.
Forward Motion -- We advance by focusing on what is possible in the
moment and doing it. Obstacles are marked for later discussion, not
used to stop the process. If we hit a boulder, we note it on the map and
keep walking. We'll come back and unearth it later on.
Solution-Seeking -- This work is so complex that focusing on what
won't work will stop it. Suggesting new ideas, options, and proposals is
vulnerable, but crucial. All of us are needed to make this work.

Definition
Data
Information
v.0.0.8

Requiring only data
information…

…instead of training
datasets is the
greatest point of
debate now.

Open
Source AI
Definition
Other
Components
v.0.0.8

Others have
proposed…
… removing data
pre-processing
code requirement if
training data is not
required.

…requiring a model
card
… and data card to
standardize system
documentation.

Open Source
AI Definition
Describing Legal
Requirements
v.0.0.8

In contrast to the clear
“OSI-approved”
licenses available for
code components…
… the “OSD
compliant”
requirement for data
information...
…and “OSD
conformant”
requirement for
model parameters
have been
challenging for
reviewers to
interpret.

Preferred form to make modiﬁcations
Data information

Code

Model

Sufficiently detailed
information about
the data used to
train the system, so
that a skilled person
can recreate a
substantially
equivalent system
using the same or
similar data.

The source code
used to train and run
the system.

The model
parameters
(weights and biases)

Data Information Explained
◦ The intention of Data information is to allow
developers to recreate a substantially
equivalent system using the same or similar
data.
◦ Came out of the systems review process, with
votes by volunteers.

11

Zooming in on the issues with datasets
◦ The Pile taken down after an alleged copyright
infringement in the US. But legal in Japan. Maybe
legal in EU
◦ DOLMA, initially had a restrictive license. Later
switched to a permissive one. Suffers from the
same legal uncertainties of the Pile, however the
Allen Institute has not been sued, yet.
◦ Training techniques that preserve privacy like
federated learning don’t create datasets.
12

Alternative proposals
● Use synthetic data: Experimental,
unproven technology, limited to
corner cases
● All their components must be “open
source”: This integralism ignores that
even the GNU project accepts system
library exceptions and other
compromises.

Validation Challenges

It is hard for volunteer reviewers
to find required documents
independently..

Validation Challenges

This meant a lot of the review
analysis has been incomplete.

Validation Solutions

Having the help of
system creators to locate
documents has been
crucial.

Thank you,
Arctic!

Validation Expectations

Given current system information, our expected
review results are as follows. If we are missing
information, please let us know.

What’s Next?

June - October 2024

● Complete validation phase
● Resolve comments, release v. 0.0.9 after
validation
● Cut the release candidate with sufficient
endorsement

Complete the Validation
Phase

Thanks,
LLM360!

1. Reach out to AI system creators to
ﬁll in the blanks on their own systems
by pointing us to correct
documentation
2. Invite volunteers to also help us ﬁll in
these blanks
