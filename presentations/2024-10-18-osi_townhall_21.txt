Why Deﬁne Open Source AI
Now?
Frontier of OS

Shaping Regulation

Combat Open-Washing

Deﬁning Open Source AI is
the most signiﬁcant
challenge facing the open
source movement.

Government regulations
have begun in the EU, US,
and elsewhere. We have
the opportunity to share
these new policies and
laws by deﬁning OSAI.

Companies are calling AI
systems “open source”
even though their licenses
contain restrictions that go
against the accepted
principles and freedoms of
open source.

Beneﬁts of Open Source AI
by Lea Gimpel
Transparency + Safety

Market Deconcentration +
AI Polyculture

OSAI provides information
essential for auditing
systems and to mitigate
bias, ensures
accountability and
transparency of data
sources, and accelerates AI
safety research

OSAI makes more models
available, spurs innovation
and quality due to
increased competition and
tackles AI monoculture by
providing more
stakeholders access to
foundational technology.

Diverse Applications
OSAI gives developers
access to resources crucial
for developing contextspeciﬁc, localized applications that are representative of cultural and
linguistic diversity and allow
for model aligned with
different value systems.

Co-Designing
the OSAID
How we created the Open Source AI
Deﬁnition through global consultation.

Co-Designing the OSAID
A Global Snapshot
Our co-design process included in-person
workshops on five continents – South America,
North America, Africa, Europe, and Asia – and
virtual participants from more than 35 countries.

To achieve better global representation in the co-design process, we conducted outreach to
Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color, particularly women and individuals from the
Global South.

Validation Review

Each system is reviewed on a public form, to maximize transparency.

Validation is ongoing. We have found that creator participation is in

Validation Progress most cases necessary to identify all the legal documents needed to
ascertain openness. Last updated on October 7, 2024.

The AI conundrums
“If we assume, for example, that the definition requires full
release of datasets, one thing is certain: in Julia’s words, it
would be “a definition for which few existing systems qualify.”
(OSI note: also less powerful and limited to specific domains

https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2024/07/03/ai-conundrums/

We can't ask for people to
release datasets that are
illegal to be distributed,
like private data.
And we don't want to say
that medical AI can never
be Open Source AI either.

A long history of
exceptions
“The GNU C library uses a special kind of copyleft called the GNU
Library General Public License, which gives permission to link
proprietary software with the library. Why make this exception? [...]
It is not a matter of principle;[...] but strategically it seems that
disallowing them would do more to discourage use of the GNU
system than to encourage development of free applications
Richard Stallman
https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/fsfs/rms-essays.pdf

Board Guidance
The OSI Board requires a deﬁnition that is:

Supported by
diverse stakeholders

Provides real-life
examples

Ready by
October 2024

The deﬁnition
needs to have
approval by end
users, developers,
deployers and
subjects of AI,
globally.

The deﬁnition must
include relevant
examples of AI
systems that comply
with it at the time of
approval, so cannot
have an empty set.

A usable version of
the deﬁnition
needs to be ready
for approval by the
board at the
October board
meeting.

New FAQ entry (preview)
Open training data: data that can be copied, preserved and reshared. It provides the best way to enable users to study the
system.
Public training data: data that others can inspect as long as it remains available. This also enables users to study the work.
However, this data can degrade as links or references are lost or removed from network availability. To obviate this, different
communities will have to work together to define standards, procedures, tools and governance models to overcome this risk,
and Data Information is required in case the data becomes later unavailable..
Obtainable training data: data that can be obtained, including for a fee. This information provides transparency and is
similar to a purchasable component in an open hardware system. The Data Information provides a means of understanding
this data other than obtaining or purchasing it. This is an area that is likely to change rapidly and will need careful monitoring
to protect Open Source AI developers.
Unshareable non-public training data: data that cannot be shared for explainable reasons, like Personally Identifiable
Information (PII). For this class of data, the ability to study some of the system's biases demands a detailed description of the
data – what it is, how it was collected, its characteristics, and so on – so that users can understand the biases and
categorization underlying the system.

RC1
Data Information: Sufficiently detailed information about the data used to train the system so that a skilled
person can recreatebuild a substantially equivalent system, together with the code requirements listed
below. Data Information shall be made available under terms that allow the copying, modification, and
redistribution of the information.
In particular, if used, this wouldmust include:
(1) a listing of all publicly available training data;
(2) a listing of all training data obtainable from third parties and where to obtain it, including for a fee; and
(3) a detailed description of all data, including unshareable data, that provides information about the
provenance of the data, its scope and characteristics, how the data was obtained and selected, the labeling
procedures and data cleaning methodologies.

RC1
Code: The complete source code used to train and run the system. The Code shall represent the full
specification of how the Data Information was processed and how the training was done. Code shall be
made available under OSI-approved licenses.
* For example, if used, this must include code used for pre-processing data, code used for training, validation
and testing, supporting libraries like tokenizers and hyperparameters search code, inference code, and model
architecture.
Parameters: The model parameters, such as weights or other configuration settings. Parameters shall be
made available under OSI-approved terms[^4].
* For example, this might include checkpoints from key intermediate stages of training as well as the final
optimizer state.
The licensing or other contractual terms applied to these elements and to any combination thereof
may contain conditions that require any modified version to be released under the same license as the
original.

The Board requires that the definition have approval by end users,

Stakeholder Groups developers, deployers and subjects of AI, globally.
