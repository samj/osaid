One Mic, One Speaker -- Please allow one person to speak at a time.
Take Space, Make Space -- If you tend to talk more, we invite you to
make space for others to share. If you tend not to share, we invite you
to speak up.
Kindness -- This work is hard, but we don't have to be. Gentleness and
curiosity help. Those who use insults or hate speech will need to leave
the meeting.
Forward Motion -- We advance by focusing on what is possible in the
moment and doing it. Obstacles are marked for later discussion, not
used to stop the process. If we hit a boulder, we note it on the map and
keep walking. We'll come back and unearth it later on.
Solution-Seeking -- This work is so complex that focusing on what
won't work will stop it. Suggesting new ideas, options, and proposals is
vulnerable, but crucial. All of us are needed to make this work.
Anything else?

The objective for 2024

Open Source AI Deﬁnition
version 1.0

Deﬁnition of AI system

Preamble
Out of scope issues
4 freedoms
License checklist

What is Open Source AI
To be Open Source, an AI system needs to be available under
legal terms that grant the freedoms to:
● Use the system for any purpose and without having to ask
for permission.
● Study how the system works and inspect its components.
● Modify the system to change its recommendations,
predictions or decisions to adapt to your needs.
● Share the system with or without modiﬁcations, for any
purpose.

What is the preferred form to make
modiﬁcations to an AI system?

Getting the speciﬁcations
AI systems

As deﬁned by the
OECD.

Checklist

What elements are
necessary to:
- use
- study
- modify
- share
an AI system?

For each artifact,
evaluate which
laws apply. Some
will be under
“Intellectual
Property” regimes,
some will be under
other regimes.

We’ll match the
components and
the identiﬁed legal
frameworks with
the terms of the
legal documents
already in use,
where available.

After repeating
this exercise
enough times,
we’ll be able to
generalize the
outcomes and
write the specs to
evaluate the
freedoms granted.

Purpose
● Process -- OSI has been convening a global
conversation to ﬁnd the deﬁnition of open source AI for
almost two years.
● Track -- The 2024 objective scope for Track 1: System
Testing is to discover what components need to be
available in each AI system for the whole system to be
studied, used, modiﬁed, and shared. We plan to
complete this track at the latest by May.
● Working group report -- objective is to talk through
initial points of difference on what components of
Llama 2 would need to be open for the whole AI system
to be studied, used, modiﬁed, and shared.
10

Framing
● Document – We’ll review the components table in the
Llama 2 specs doc and decide which exist in that AI
system, with a focus on resolving disagreement.
● Expectations – We’ll see how much of the table we get
through. (Insights on tempo and pace will be among
the learnings from this meeting.)
● Anything else? – Are there any other expectations or
framings we should put in place before we begin
working through the components table?

What do you need to give an input and get an
output from LLaMA2? (use)
Code

Which of these components is strictly necessary to use
Llama2?

Data preprocessing code

Not necessary BG EL
Nice for scientific reproducibility DT SM JT

Training code

Not necessary BG , EL, JT

Code used to perform inference for benchmark tests

Not necessary BG , DT, EL, SM, JT

Inference code

Necessary SM, EL, DT BG

Evaluation code
Any libraries or other code artifacts that are part of the
system, such as tokenizers and hyperparameter search
code, if used.

Necessary BG,EL SM
Should be split by “do you need it to run the model?”, so a
tokenizer is necessary while hyperparameter search code
is not (you do hyperparameter search at training time)

Next questions
What do you need
to understand how
LLaMA2 was built,
how can it be
ﬁne-tuned, what
biases, get a sense
of why an output to
an input … ? (study)
◦

how was it built,
explain its
performance,
etc.

What do you need
to give an input and
get a different
output from
LLaMA2? (modify)
◦

Techniques and
tools to
adapt/modify
for use including
ﬁne-tune and
optimize.

What do you need
to let others give an
input and get an
output from
LLaMA2? (share)
◦

Either
as-received or
after ﬁne-tuning
and other
modiﬁcations.

Deﬁnition

OSI’s immediate next steps
- more publicity to the process
- public discussion forum https://discuss.opensource.org
- bi-weekly townhalls
- more opportunities to volunteer
- update project landing page
- reach out to more stakeholders
- raise funds for 2024 meetings
