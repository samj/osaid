One Mic, One Speaker -- Please allow one person to speak at a time.
Take Space, Make Space -- If you tend to talk more, we invite you to
make space for others to share. If you tend not to share, we invite you
to speak up.
Kindness -- This work is hard, but we don't have to be. Gentleness and
curiosity help. Those who use insults or hate speech will need to leave
the meeting.
Forward Motion -- We advance by focusing on what is possible in the
moment and doing it. Obstacles are marked for later discussion, not
used to stop the process. If we hit a boulder, we note it on the map and
keep walking. We'll come back and unearth it later on.
Solution-Seeking -- This work is so complex that focusing on what
won't work will stop it. Suggesting new ideas, options, and proposals is
vulnerable, but crucial. All of us are needed to make this work.
Anything else?

We’re interested in reviewing about 10 AI systems self-described as open as part of
this definition validation phase. Those marked (*) have were reviewed in previous
phases.

It was hard for
volunteer reviewers
to find required

review.

This meant a lot of

What’s Next?

June - October 2024

● Complete validation phase (June 10)
● Resolve comments, release v. 0.0.9 after
validation
● Cut the release candidate with sufficient
endorsement
12

Complete the Validation
Phase

Thanks,
LLM360
team!

1. Reach out to AI system creators to
ﬁll in the blanks on their own systems
by pointing us to correct documentation
2. Invite volunteers to also help us ﬁll in these
blanks (forum post forthcoming)
3. We’re also currently engaging in email and
phone debriefs with reviewers to better
understand the blockers they faced.

Simplify the Validation Process
We’re exploring
replacing the

The renewed discussion on data
1. The AWS Open Source team posted a
range of concerns with v 0.0.8, foremost on
data.
2. Linux Foundation team recommended
adding Data card to the required
components. Also they argued that Data
preprocessing code is unlikely to be shared
if the dataset is not shared, too.
18

Other relevant posts
1. The LLM360 team voluntarily ran their system
through the v.0.0.8 review process.
2. Stefano posted on whether and how OSI should
certify Open Source AI.
