One Mic, One Speaker -- Please allow one person to speak at a time.
Take Space, Make Space -- If you tend to talk more, we invite you to
make space for others to share. If you tend not to share, we invite you
to speak up.
Kindness -- This work is hard, but we don't have to be. Gentleness and
curiosity help. Those who use insults or hate speech will need to leave
the meeting.
Forward Motion -- We advance by focusing on what is possible in the
moment and doing it. Obstacles are marked for later discussion, not
used to stop the process. If we hit a boulder, we note it on the map and
keep walking. We'll come back and unearth it later on.
Solution-Seeking -- This work is so complex that focusing on what
won't work will stop it. Suggesting new ideas, options, and proposals is
vulnerable, but crucial. All of us are needed to make this work.
Anything else?

Open Source AI Definition
The 4 Freedoms for AI
1. Use the system for any purpose and without having
to ask for permission.
2. Study how the system works and inspect its
components.
3. Modify the system for any purpose, including to
change its output.
4. Share the system for others to use with or without

Virtual Workgroups
Selected to represent a diversity of approaches to AI openness:
1.

Llama 2: commercial project, accompanied by limited amount of
science and with a restrictive license

2.

BLOOM: open science project, with lots of details released but
shared with a restrictive license

3.

Pythia: open science project, with a permissive license

4.

OpenCV: open source project, with ML components outside of the
generative AI space

16

better global representation, we conducted outreach to Black, Indigenous,
Workgroup Members Toandachieve
other people of color, particularly women and individuals from the Global South.
